# Material-UI (MUI)

## Generic Layout with MUI

Turning a (good) design into a real working webpage is a skill a web developer must have. MUI is a powerful React UI library that can help you greatly with building a basic, functioning and aesthetically pleasing website.

## User Stories
- Users can see 5 job postings on their screen with the job title, skills required and description.
- Users can see a responsive navigation bar.
- Users can browse the website on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Users can see (non-functioning) pagination buttons.
- Users can see no more than 4 skills for each job.
- :rocket: Users can use the pagination buttons and see different pages.
- :rocket: Users can see a dark theme.

- App Bar

You may need to modify the theme too.
